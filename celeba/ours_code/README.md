# Code for CelebA

We upload the code for CelebA dataset. This code is adapted from the official implementation of [TAG](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/tag).

`celeba-ours-collect.py` is used for collecting the transfer gain.

`celeba-eval.py` is used for training all possible groupings for further evaluation.

`celeba-grouping.ipynb` is used for grouping tasks based on collected transfer gain.

The required python packages are listed on top of each scripts.
